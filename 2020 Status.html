<h1 id="status-productive-in-a-pandemic">2020 Status: Productive in a Pandemic</h1>
<p>In 2019, I worked with two companies, about 10 people.</p>
<p>Then I started consulting.</p>
<p>In 2020, I worked with <em>fourteen</em> companies, about <em>90</em> people! Projects lasted from two to six weeks. It was fun, if sometimes chaotic.</p>
<p>Here are some</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<h3 id="reach-out-for-1-on-1s-with-the-team">Reach out for 1-on-1s with the Team</h3>
<p>Life as a consultant is measured video-meeting to video-meeting. A ton of acronyms and terms and ideas and people whirl around, to often float away never to be seen again.</p>
<p>By establishing a clear relationship with individuals in the team, the team lead and your coworkers, it’s <em>much</em> easier to focus on what the project’s goals and objectives are, and your role in delivering value to the client.</p>
<h3 id="take-lots-of-notes-with-pen-and-paper">Take lots of notes with pen and paper</h3>
<p>Research shows that the mind more easily focuses when using a writing implement (pen, pencil, or digital pen). Even drawing in circles while people speak, helps the mind focus. In 2020 between engagements and John Tells All work I filled  <em>six</em> journals!</p>

<h3 id="do-self-management-of-tasks">Do self-management of Tasks</h3>
<p>Projects have variable, and often minimal, project management. Do your own definition and tracking of Tasks and Goals. I’m a fan of Pomodoro  XX link to enhance focus and get things done, combined with Pyramid Method to organize lower-level Tasks into those that contribute to Goals, and those that should be set aside.</p>
<p>Pyramid Method task management is in my book, so I’ll be advertising it on this blog soon :)</p>

<h3 id="prioritize-self-management-of-health">Prioritize self-management of health</h3>
<p>Projects want everything done with best practices, fully documented, production-ready, and now. To help this along, we take care of ourselves, our bodies and minds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>take walks to relax the body and reset the mind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use Pomodoro or other techniques to create a focus <em>muscle</em> to make it easier to produce on demand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>relatedly, study mindfulness meditation (using Headspace or other tools) to be able to be calm and not react against challenges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>schedule 1-on-1s with friends to help get perspective</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="over-communicate">Over-communicate</h3>
<p>It’s not hard to get overwhelmed and run around in circles. By establishing a relationship with your team, it’s easy to define your expectations and next actions, then discuss to ensure you’re moving forward.</p>
<h3 id="prioritize-life">Prioritize life</h3>
<p>It’s a job. Do your work, create value, but at the end of the day your friends and family will be there to support you. Be with them, cherish them! My lovely wife is always with me, and I strive to keep myself in shape to be with her and support her for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>
<p>My career focus has been Quality DevOps/Dev with a side of Kubernetes. Consulting in 2020 was fun but for Q1 I’m interested in other challenges. Bring it on, 2021!</p>
