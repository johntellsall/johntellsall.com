Upping your Programming Game course

This course gives nonprofessional programmers the skills they need to
succeed with developing their own programs.

The course has two focuses. In the first, students will learn
techniques to rapidly develop high quality programs using the Idea -
Code - Feedback loop. Each idea is explained in concrete terms,
showing *why* it is useful, so that the concept is more easily
mastered. The course also focuses on providing a strong practical
guidance with modern Python programs. The most important standard
modules are reviewed and demonstrated, with concrete real-world
examples.

For CLIENT, the Upping your Programming Game course is taught in three,
2.5-3 hour classes. Each class consists of 1/3 instruction, and 2/3
interactive lab.  Instruction utilizes professional developer theory,
solidified with in-class Python projects.

These are private, in-house classes for CLIENT. The fee is FEE/class,
for up to 12 people. CLIENT will provide space suitable for training --
for example, a meeting room with projector, Internet access, and
enough seating, and power outlets for the participants.

Students will bring a laptop to work on with the following installed:
- A text editor such as Sublime Text 3
- A web browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox
