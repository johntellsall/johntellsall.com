# Zero to Webapp in Python

Web development is amazingly complicated. Can we get away with not learning that much?  John will do an interactive workshop on how to start with nothing and wind up with working web app!

Technologies:
* Python
* HTML+CSS (a tiny amount)
* Bash shell (a little)

The goal is to deliver a simple working webapp, then refine it with small changes, each time understanding each detail. Students will become much more comfortable with Python, the console, and web technologies in general

## Date & Location

Saturday, July 1, 10am-1pm
Cars.com, Santa Monica -- exact address TBD -- near the library

## Prerequisites:

* laptop with Python (installed) or [Cloud9](cloud9.io) account -- [Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olUjFDKRDYo)
