# Zero to Webapp in Python

Web development is amazingly complicated. Can we get away with not learning that much?  John will do an interactive workshop on how to start with nothing and wind up with a working web app!

Students will learn how to write a tiny webapp without their brains exploding.

# Technologies:
* Python
* HTML+CSS (a tiny amount)
* Bash shell (a little)

The goal is to deliver a simple working webapp, then refine it with small changes, each time understanding each detail. Students will become much more comfortable with Python, the console, and web technologies in general

## Date, Location, Fee, Amenities

Saturday, July 1, 10am-1pm
Cars.com, Santa Monica -- exact address TBD -- near the library

This is a free workshop. There will be munchies (brain food) and hopefully coffee.

## Prerequisites:

* laptop with Python (installed) or [Cloud9](http://cloud9.io) account -- [Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olUjFDKRDYo)

* Python 3 is preferred, but 2.7 is fine

* local install: consider the "Python for humans" distribution [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
