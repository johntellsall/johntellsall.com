## How do we get better?

How do we invest our time, energy, money to get better?

People have misinterpreted Malcom Gladwell to answer this "study for 10,000 hours and you'll get great" (book: [Outliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_%28book%29))

Cal Newport quotes research saying the _type_ of study effort is more important than the _amount_ of effort. In his example, he worked for years to become a musician, and became just average. His buddy studied for the same amount of time and became an expert. The difference? Cal _avoided_ challenge, and stayed towards what he knew well and was comfortable for him. His friend _intentionally challenged himself_, learned a lot more, and became a professional.

The noted human performance researcher [Anders Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson) defined Deliberate Practice (DP) as:

> [A]ctivities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of
> effectively improving specific aspects of an individualâ€™s performance

.
In my view, this is restated as:

>To get achieve your goals:
>1) spend time and effort studying, and
>2) **get feedback** from your studies

The core of my book is on Feedback Loops, so I'll be discussing this more, later.
