<p>Recently I took the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD). Here’s the study program I used.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>using my O’Reilly subscription I went through Ben Muschko’s prep course a couple times:</p>
<ul>
<li>course: <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/learning-paths/learning-path-certified/9781492061021/">https://learning.oreilly.com/learning-paths/learning-path-certified/9781492061021/</a></li>
<li>sample code <a href="https://github.com/bmuschko/ckad-prep">https://github.com/bmuschko/ckad-prep</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>also the Linux Foundation course LFD259 <a href="https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/learn/course/kubernetes-for-developers-lfd259/">https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/learn/course/kubernetes-for-developers-lfd259/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People on Reddit gave me valuable real-world info about the test. You only interact with the proctor via text window. It’s pretty intense. It’s a game of knowing which questions to spend your time on and when to punt and come back later. Be super organized!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly I worked through dgkanatsios exercises. These were very helpful! <a href="https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises">https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises</a></p>

</ul>
<p>You have to be FAST. I wasn’t enough, I didn’t pass…   Which is cool, I want my passing grade to  <em>mean</em>  something when I re-take it.</p>
<p>If you study AND you’ve been using K8s for a while you might be okay</p>
<p>I’ve now built another Study Path, focusing on about 50/50 AWS and Kubernetes, with focus on real-world developer/devops experience.</p>
<p>Yesterday was AWS Lightsail. Did you know you can now use it with containers? For me Lightsail isn’t useful but I was very happy to learn what it’s useful for in comparison with other tools.</p>
